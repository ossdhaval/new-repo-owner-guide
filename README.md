### Licensing

What does a license do: It controls how others use your code. For example, Can they sell your code and earn money? 

Your GH repo can live without a license. It is not mandatory to have license, but in that case you don't have any claim on the contents of your repo. 

GH let's you choose a license when you start a new repo.

- `GitHub discussions` is excellent collaboration tool that is available to you from day one. Many large open source projects use them as their main tool for community collaboration, for instance [Janssen Project](https://jans.io/discussions). Don't wait till you create Slack, Discord for your project. Just start with GitHub discussions with zero time investment.
