## Licensing

What does a license do: It controls how others use your code. For example, Can they sell your code and earn money? 

Your GH repo can live without a license. It is not mandatory to have license, but in that case you don't have any claim on the contents of your repo. 

GH let's you choose a license when you start a new repo.
